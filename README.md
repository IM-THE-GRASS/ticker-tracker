A site built in [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) for [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/) that tracks how many tickets you have, what your goal is and how close you are to that goal



### Self hosting:
To self host and for developmentyou need python 3.11 or above[^1] 
in terminal, navigate to the repo folder and run 

`python -m pip install -r /requirements.txt`

to run just write `python -m reflex run` in the command line



[^1]:version 3.11 or above is fine, older versions may work but I haven't tested them
